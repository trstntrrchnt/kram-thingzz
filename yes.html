				<p class="ay">Hi bb, I know this sounds stupid but can I make ligaw? I know we have feelings for each other and did things na, but I want to do it properly lalo na we both don't have experience pag dating dito hehe. Pre I really don't know how to make ligaw and hell I can't even express myself properly but then everything changed when I met you, I started doing things I thought I would never do and I thank you for that. Right now as I'm writing this I'm still having difficulties but for you sige I'll try. Hi my pedo! I just want you to know that you are the greatest thing that's ever happened to me. I'm grateful to have met someone like you, and I'm delighted I can be myself around you. You bring me comfort everyday just by being yourself, just seeing you and hearing your voice brightens even the gloomiest days. Baby always keep in mind that you are beautiful even if you don't see it. I know those stupid people you talked to took you for granted and you probably don't trust people now easily, but I'll try my best to make sure you see what my perspective looks like, how you deserve more than to be taken for granted. I want you to see that you are more than what people see or hear about. You are more than what people say. I hope I can show you that you deserve honest and unconditional love. I wish I could show you how I truly feel, how serious I am for you. You know, I dreamt about you this morning, I did not remember what we were talking about but I remembered how I was stuck looking at your pretty face the entire time, I was completely lost in your beauty, the more I recall, the more lovely the dream was. I know it's too early to say this but baby I realized that you are the person I want to spend the rest of my life with. Baby, you cpmplete me so much. You are the only person who actually showed me what love feels like, I feel so safe when I talk to you, it's so comfortable, feels like home. I will always care for you no matter what heppens between us. I'd rather fix things with you instead of breaking up. I wouldn't wanna start with somebody else, I'd rather restart with you a million times. I really hope I don't lose you. I know we may have our ups and down, but that never stops me from loving you. i'll always love you the same. I may not be the best, bu I promise you I will treat you how you're supposed to be treated. You deserve the whole world and more. I love you <3</p>
				<p class="ay">If I ever do something that bothers you, tell me right away. I hate hurting your feelings, or doing something that bothers you. I hate when we argue but it happens, I know we don't really argue as bad but I would still want to talk it out with you, if you ever lose feelings, please tell me instead of leading me on. I love you so much bb mwaaaaaa</p>
